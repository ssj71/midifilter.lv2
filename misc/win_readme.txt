midifilter.LV2 Plugins
======================

A collection of 25+ MIDI data filters in LV2 plugin format.

The filters follow the basic rules:

 * One MIDI input, one MIDI output
 * No custom GUI, control inputs only
 * Every control can be automated, the plugins handle dynamic parameter changes
 * All plugins report their latency to the host (for most of them it is zero)
 * DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself principle) - simple filters that can be combined in a network


LV2 Plugins are installed to "Common Files\LV2\"
